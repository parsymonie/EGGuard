## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial release.
- `egguard refresh` — download every UT1 Capitole category, write an
  EnforceGate domain list and a matching `.policy` rule for each, and trigger a
  single live engine reload.
- `egguard list` — print the 66-category catalogue with the action resolved for
  each category under the current configuration.
- `egguard version`.
- Conditional HTTP downloads (ETag / If-Modified-Since) plus content-hash
  comparison, so unchanged categories are skipped and no needless engine reload
  is triggered.
- Per-category download state cached atomically on the toolbox volume.
- Bounded retries with exponential backoff per category.
- Decompression-bomb and path-traversal guards in the tarball parser.
- YAML configuration with per-category action overrides, a `default_action`
  fallback, and `include` / `skip` category selection.
- Toolbox launcher (`scripts/egguard`) that runs from a clone without
  `pip install`, plus `deploy/` config and cron templates.
- One-line JSON run summary for SIEM ingestion.
- Apache-2.0 license for the code; `NOTICE` carrying the upstream CC BY-SA 4.0
  attribution for the UT1 data.
